  <tr>
    <td>Although it was mainly maths and thinking, I learnt by staying near the front and only talking when I was allowed to so I could actually learn what we were doing. I also tried to ignore other people talking.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I didn't put my hand up to answer questions at all during the lesson which I need to work on and also fiddling with stuff by my desk such as messing around with the keyboard.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I’ll try and contribute more to the class discussions and avoid fiddling with my surroundings because these 2 things inhibited my learning the most. I’ll also try my hardest which I wasn’t really doing in the lesson.</td>
  </tr>
